All things sleep compliance &amp; automation

This project is a running experiment on the implementation of sleep study subject compliance automation.  
I have looked to replicate the daily ritual that I do as a human.  In place of visualizing Tableau plots and checking
S3, we will be utilizing this script to automatically do these thing for us.  The ultimate result
will be a "comliance report", that will automatically be printed and logged.
